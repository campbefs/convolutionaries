do you think it would make sense for wenxiu to help on row 6 (describing high complexity biz) or is this something that you think dovetails with row 5 (mid-complex breakdown)?

sounds good - i just started a thread with you/me/fede on what i see as some of the challenges; i think we can work out in smaller group. then happy to adapt the model moving forward. 

i think we’ve had too many syncs, too many people per sync, and timelines too short. welcome other issues you are seeing, and then we can course correct on each.

yooo you already know this, but once we wrap up like 1b, i think 2b, 3a, 3b are the key like DS-y analyses that we’ll use and then all the other rows sorta take those as inputs

might be easier to organize around those potentially vs. the questions they drive, but you probs know much better than me 🙂

Hey Sarah, I just chatted with Wenxiu and I don't know if she's aligned on the project plan

that's good to know!! is it more about the work itself or the timeline?
SarahSeptember 25, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
welcome as much direct feedback!

September 25, 2023
the issue is we have Max's analytics plan AND the project plan. I think the solution here is to maybe consolidate or at least get alignment across the two plans. Personally, I think the project plan is okay, it seems like a more granular version of the analytics plan, but I acknowledge the desire to stick to the original plan too.
Sarah
September 25, 2023
totally - basically 3b is max’s original plan
SarahSeptember 25, 2023
and so is 1b (break down mid-complexity)
SarahSeptember 25, 2023
(as it’s a pre-cursor to 3b)
SarahSeptember 25, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
transparently, the delta is 2b (do biz move from low—>high) and 3a (what is adoption/retention for the diff channels per segment)
You sent
September 25, 2023
yeah, and those are essentially questions from leads so they're still important
Sarah
September 25, 2023
yeah - but like we’re not trying to make this terrible haha - so if we wanna loop in more peeps, that’s def an option
SarahSeptember 25, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
last week was miz for everyone on the team, no need ot do that again
You sent
September 25, 2023
I find its also hard to get alignment between just DS to DS lol
Sarah
September 25, 2023
if taking on those aspects means that, let’s loop in more peeps or figure out how to make more time in the day (e.g., remove meetings, de-pri other stuff)
SarahSeptember 25, 2023
yeah totally - sorry for putting ya in that position too
SarahSeptember 25, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
i don’t wanna add MORE meetings, but would that help to speak live?
You sent
September 25, 2023
okay thanks, maybe you could chat with Wenxiu and get her buy in on that plan? I do feel they're closely related / overlapping
Sarah
September 25, 2023
also how are you feeling about ht eproject plan? you don’t have to be aligned! it’s more work than before!
SarahSeptember 25, 2023
ok cool; i can see if she’s open to it 🙂 i hate to add more meetings when i said we would cancel them all hahaha
SarahSeptember 25, 2023
didn’t mean the “hahah” as actually funny

I'm mostly focused on 1B, will worry about the rest later. Overall it still feels reasonable, it's just the timing that I'm unsure of.  like they are pertinent questions to answer

ya my thought on #2 is that #3b is a cut based on tool usage (BiiM only, BiiM + Unified INbox, INbox only, etc.) with all the CTX metrics
You sent
September 26, 2023
I got confused on MAB -> MAMBA, I thought leads asked Low Complexity to Mid Complexity
Sarah
September 26, 2023
ah in the email, they were like - can we even move a biz from MAB to MAMBA?
SarahSeptember 26, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
if not, they why do we care at all about MAB that aren’t MAMBA
You sent
September 26, 2023
maybe resurrected churned businesses as opposed to upselling new businesses to messaging
Sarah
September 26, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
could be another argument to either de-pri low or focus our segmentation on MAMBA (vs. all MAB)
Sarah Cornfeld replied to you
September 26, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
that’s interesting! so i guess that analysis might look at what that breakdown is
You sent
September 26, 2023
Low to Mid would have more data because we'd at least have some 1P usage data. MAB -> MAMBA seems like a growth marketing question
You replied to Sarah Cornfeld
September 26, 2023
yeah that might be the best way to approach it
Sarah
September 26, 2023
great idea, chris! ok maybe i’ll pull that out as a separate row, and we can discuss capacity as a next step

so sounds like - feeling confident to get something tmw on the mid complex angle
You sent
September 26, 2023
Honestly, feels like messenger is the focus to me. I’m wondering if I should combine ig or not
Sarah
September 26, 2023
i’m gonna say something dumb that under-estimates time
SarahSeptember 26, 2023
but if it’s like 10 mins to pull just MSGR data, i would start with that and share with the group
SarahSeptember 26, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
then discuss if add IG, and hopefully we give feedback on that in enough time so if tmw morning we wanna look into (or later today), we can still add
You sent
September 26, 2023
Yeah I think that’s a good idea. Basically just picking up the threads analysis from last week on MSGR side
Sarah
September 26, 2023
yeah, but majo is gonna freak btw
SarahSeptember 26, 2023
so i think let’s leave enough time to do both i guess IN CASE
SarahSeptember 26, 2023

if MSGR makes X% of threads… then ….

i’m getting a new manager soon, but i think she wants to keep staying involved
Sarah Cornfeld replied to themself
September 26, 2023
do we know this btw - like is MSGR threads >>> IG threads
SarahSeptember 26, 2023
generally i agree with UIT focus, but when we move to WA, we typically look at TT threads (two-way)
SarahSeptember 26, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
btw that’s a scret about new mgr
You sent
September 26, 2023
Game plan: I’ll get a breakdown of IG v MSGR as step 1. Then dive into MSGR. And based on those cuts we can always add IG later. But target audience seems to be messenger
You sentSeptember 26, 2023
Yeah that’s surprising she just joined
Sarah
September 26, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
cool - yeah, if it takes only 5-25% of the time to do MSGR only, can start with that. but if not, then i’d just do it all tbh.
You replied to Sarah Cornfeld
September 26, 2023
I also am aligned on UIT. Part of the trouble was getting IG side to do UIT bc half of IG threads are business initiated
Sarah
September 26, 2023
yeah, so it’s not super straightforward. if you are handling volume, it’s about threads i guess…
SarahSeptember 26, 2023
but ideally we are consistent with existing segmentation
SarahSeptember 26, 2023
hence UIT
SarahSeptember 26, 2023
but man
SarahSeptember 26, 2023
maybe next half NEW segmentation lol
SarahSeptember 26, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
(probs not tho, don’t worry)
You sent
September 26, 2023
That would be great but if we do a good job maybe we can just put this to rest too
Sarah
September 26, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
ok given the number of questions i’m getting from MJ, i think there is a real risk she will want the IG breakdown in there too. i think ultimately if we end up going with threads, we’re going to need to do it for both sides anyway (together and probs individually).

just wanting to make sure you have the full context when you make decision for which to do first. i am going to stop pinging you now (unless i’m spoken to!).

Sarah Cornfeld
Hey Chris, I was thinking about our chat yesterday. thanks for doing those interesting cuts; def don’t wanna interrupt the analysis, but had a few quick thoughts. 

I think leads def are interested in seeing the threads cut (even if the team lands on a rec to also include threads / x-fam). Are you good to include that data? I think the outstanding piece was to figure out how many sub-divisions in mid-complex.

I was also thinking that something LIKE slide 6 could help clearly communicate the differences in cuts (they’re used to the format). We can add the data for revenue cause i know you recommend we add something like that. I’m happy to make the slides to save the team time, but just thought could be interesting (the piece that might be missing now is the IG vs. MSGR primary interface). if you have another idea of course that’s cool. not trying to be overly prescriptive, just share some ideas if saves time / helps.

Would also be good to get your guys’ thoughts on the rationale (why we like one vs. the other) when you share the recommendation! 

Anywho, wanted to get your take on that / the output y’all were thinking just to avoid any swirl later! 

I can take a first pass at drafting up note to leads and we can integrate the findings on mid-complexity after that! thank you!

we are sending to leads by end of day,  ideally around 5pm ET haha so not too late on our end, but think we might need to go a little later than that. was hoping to get our internal team to review by around 3pm.

do you think we should consider slide 11 first? how to group the biz (if at all)? maybe that will help with our segmentation.
Sarah
October 16, 2023

i think the biggest question is your rec for how we group segments (slide 11)! wanna take a pass at that and then maybe you/me/fede can discuss?

I think what I was trying to undersatnd:

Among MSGR in inbox users that also use IG to message (across any IG interface/surface), what % adopt IG in Inbox?
SarahOctober 26, 2023

Do ya know if for the alpha test, we could pull a subset of users from the 13.6M target audience that max developed? Is that a query that we can still use/adapt?
SarahNovember 3, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
I was also wondering if we had any signal on the characteristics or feature usage among the 30% of biz that retain vs. those that don’t. Now that we’re at ~8K users, feels like we might have some signal on what’s driving some of this.

November 3, 2023
Hey hey - 
yes I can find the 13.6M target audience query. I think it was for priority markets though, and when I asked about priority markets you said its a broader audience 

features usage

I'll have to pick this up on next week. Top priority is the funnel and then feature usage would either be P1 or a great understand question to answer in the near future

target audience query

—> wooo - ok cool - yeah just wasn’t sure if it was repeatable or not. sounds great that it is! 

—> AFAIK the 13.6M wasn’t based on priority markets (i have a breakdown of # users per market: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c-iQTHcuA1tDXvhlruRp4aj5tCYff3mDwsqoCuH4FOM/edit#gid=1410649425), but we can filter from there. 

—> we might be able to simplify the query though because we won’t want the “WA Only” users —> mostly just the inbox-active ones to recruit from for alpha.

Understand Roadmapping Guidance for 1P Solutions
Following-up the guidance shared on Understand Roadmapping from Business Messaging leads, we wanted to provide further guidance for 1P Solutions teams.



We are asking that each team identify 3-4 top understand themes/questions by EOD Wednesday, Nov 15.

We want this first pass to be a lightweight process; this first pass should be a draft; don’t worry about wordsmithing or ensuring you have all of the details

Focus on the top questions that will drive your strategy and product forward

Consider some of the top questions/areas we’ve discussed during planning/roadmapping

Review Business Messaging Leads’ guidance

This should not be a collection of projects; once we align on the top questions, we can start to detail out the related projects and POCs

Add the questions to your team’s tab in this doc

Focus on filling out columns D and E with the high-level questions and the intended impact of answering the question (see the template for examples)

We will share any feedback, questions, or thoughts with the teams async



1P Solutions Understand Leads will then aggregate the questions/themes to share with CTX Ads leads by Nov 20th, which will then be rolled up to Business Messaging Understand leads.



Teams should continue to iterate on the Understand Roadmap plans during this time as we get additional feedback and guidance. In December, we can start to identify the specific projects, POCs, and timelines to answer the questions.



Milestones:

**Nov. 15: **Teams identify 3-4 top understand themes/questions

Nov. 20: 1P Understand leads share aggregated themes/questions with CTX Ads

First week of December: will share guidance on the overall questions/themes

Dec 15: Teams to share plans on the specific projects, POCs, and timelines

Week of Jan 1: Share projects and full Understand Roadmap with Business Messaging Leads

Week of Jan 8th: Finalize Business Messaging Understand Roadmap



If you have any questions, please add below or reach out to 1P Understand Leads: Darcie, Max, Numair, Jiangyun (Julie).

hey chris!! looks like we have a small task for WA in Inbox understand roadmapping. took the first stab at it, but would ya have a sec to take a look and make any edits you see fit to the planned understand roadmap for H1? 

i think everything is filled out, but good if you could double check columns F to I (STO, Collaborators, Priority, Timing) plus anything else you might be interested in 🙂

is the major tradeoff between coex-specific numbers vs. more end-to-end flow? 

i feel kinda strongly about including the eligibility check in our metrics because if that’s broken, the whole thing is moot 

but not sure if there’s a diff way to measure it - like do we just track the components separately? 

i am somehow passionate about this haha

December 14, 2023
Two concerns:
1. Using Activation rate for Beta exit criteria could cause issues, if the % of SMB Accounts onboarding to WA in Inbox drops in H1 it could block launch (even if we do everything correct and the funnel is fantastic).
2. Activation Rate is end-to-end and meant to incorporate both Coex & Clean Accounts. We probably won't get as clean a read on the Coex onboarding.  Also, Coex is only being rolled out to a select few businesses so the real gains to activation rate will happen when we move to GA and that's when we should leverage the metric.
You sent
December 14, 2023
but with that said, we can still measure it, report on it, and understand it to get us ready for Beta Exit
You sentDecember 14, 2023
does that address your concerns? do you agree and anything I missed that you feel strongly about?
Sarah
December 14, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
Thanks Chris haha I know you’re getting ready for PTO. 

One option is to look at activation rate for SMB account numbers. 

Another option is to look at it overall - the only failure would be if they use consumer app number. Clean accounts and coex would pass. That would be helpful to know if that for some reason goes up because our ultimate goal is to unblock ability for biz to onboard and the best way to do that is coex. 

What are your thoughts on these alternate measures?
You replied to Sarah Cornfeld
December 14, 2023
One option is to look at activation rate for SMB account numbers. 


that's basically onboarding rate, because once they pass eligibile and confirm its SMB Account then its the same measurement as onboarding rate, right?
Sarah
December 14, 2023
Yes ideally we have 100% pass rate at this step. 

But if something is broken it wouldn’t be 100%. I think that could be helpful to know or just make sure it works.
SarahDecember 14, 2023
That’s the part I’m encouraging us to measure but if that’s best tracked a different way then that’s cool too.
SarahDecember 14, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld
Just feel like we should hold the coex team accountable for that. And how awesome to get like a huge pass rate haha
You replied to Sarah Cornfeld
December 14, 2023
for 2, they can fail if they use consumer app phone or Enterprise phone number. 

Maybe we can track eligibility rate separately for understand purposes, specifically breaking down the % of SMB Accounts to Total. I want to avoid blocking Beta launch because the mix of phone numbers is different than the expected value.
Sarah
December 14, 2023
Sarah Cornfeld

I think it’s really cool to be able to track our eligibility rate over time. This is the most meaningful metric we are impacting with coexistence so we should get credit for it. 

I also remember max and leads suggesting we increase our definition of onboarding rate over time haha 

And I think we agreeed we would take activation as beta exit criteria. 

I think I’d want to have this number above a certain threshold before we went to GA. If it was small for any reason it might not be efficient to do GTM.

from a measurement perspective, I think anything over 2K onboarded should be fine and then 63% of those will be Coex

i'll take it. wondering how to measure that but can cross that bridge later

1. Should we invest in product adoption in VN and TH or is the market saturated in both (with products that suit their needs)?
2. Once biz adopt, what features should we encourage them to use to drive CTX conversions?
SarahFebruary 5
I can start a doc! I was trying to look at the feature deprecation sheet to get some info but got a little lost haha
SarahFebruary 5
Sarah Cornfeld
let me check with the SBG team on timelines so we know what level of analysis we can do! not sure your schedule too!

we dont have great data on which features lead to DC because that could require almost like a causality analysis which is pretty intensive. but we can certainly look at VN / TH trends and adoption

Sarah
February 5
Sarah Cornfeld
should be a quick question to get the table we can cut our analysis by. 

basically instead of just cutting the analysis by 2-3 markets, we're going to cut by ~4-5 markets and then the SBG tiers --> so we can figure out where the opportunities are (grow UBI adoption with Tier E in PH and grow feature adoption of XYZ feature  Tier G in VN)

BiiM tab is BiiM active & no Inbox usage.  Inbox tab is all Inbox active (BiiM or not). So I guess this would add up roughly to all messaging active in mid complexity. Except neither have filters for API biz, but API are typically not in mid complexity segment.

Tanner Rozier
Software Engineer
[MBS][Mobile] Attributing SAD rate to product teams for the MBS mobile apps and the future of mobile reliability
CURRENT STATE OF %SADNESS



%SAD by team dashboards

 



Inbox well ahead of the pack in unreliability making up ~80% of total crashes on MBS iOS

 



On Android, Inbox still leads the way in unreliability, with Home not too far behind



CONTEXT



With the Product Health team transitioned into a V-team, it is essential that certain overall aspects of the app’s health are owned by the teams supporting MBS. One of the most important metrics that can technically be attributed to specific teams is SAD rate.



We find the most value from a daily %SAD rate: The amount of users that experience an app crash in a day divided by the total number of people using the app in that same day. So a 1% SAD rate means 1 out of 100 users that used the app that day experienced a crash.



HOW ATTRIBUTION IS MADE



iOS

A tool type flag is set depending on which surface the user navigates to. When a crash happens, this tool type is uploaded with the crash. In the event of a uFad, we then look if there is a top screen provided for when the crash happened. In these cases we use keywords like Home or Inbox to attribute the crash to the correct tool.



Android

Android is very similar, but the tool type flag is not as reliable. So we first look at the top screen provided by the crash and look for specific keywords, then fallback to the tool type flag if no keywords are found.



MAINTAINING A HEALTHY SAD RATE MOVING FORWARD



The Ideal



A healthy SAD rate goal which is used by FB reliability team is <1% daily SAD. iOS and Android usually differ on actual goals due to more reliability issues with Android devices (supporting a whole lot more devices and a lot of those being old, less powerful devices), but the eventual north star is <1%. Most recently for MBS specifically, iOS has aimed for <0.8% and Android has aimed for <1.65%. Frequent spikes have made maintaining both challenging.



The current situation



iOS - 0.8%-1.0%



Android - 1.4%-1.5%



The Product Health team can no longer be depended on to solely goal on SAD half over half. It is now expected for each team to maintain/improve their respective SAD rates.

PROBLEM AREAS



As is readily seen by the provided dashboard images, Inbox accounts for the vast majority of crashes on both Android and iOS:



iOS: Inbox accounts for >80% of total SAD Users



Android: Inbox account for >40% of total SAD Users



It is important to note that not all crashes attributed to Inbox are solely due to inbox code, some issue do arise from shared infra code with MBS teams. For these crashes, determining the owner and intended resolver is a shared issue among MBS teams and inbox.



OVERALL GOALS



iOS - Daily %SAD <0.8%

Infra, Home, and Post need to hold the line

Improvement goals for Inbox



Android - Daily %SAD <1.65%

Infra, Home, and Post need to hold the line

Improvement goals for Inbox



MBS POCs will work with Unified Inbox team POCs to identify the next steps to improve on the high Inbox SAD rates and maintain those improvements going forward. This is not to say Inbox needs to have as low of a crash rate as Home or other tools. Inbox is indeed a high usage tool and very complex, but purely looking at the discrepancy in inbox crashes between Android and iOS, we know something is not right and improvement can be made on the inbox side of things.



KEEPING ACCOUNTABILITY



These dashboards and queries were made so teams can track their %SAD contributions individually. PH V Team will work with each MBS team to bring %SAD goals onto their roadmaps whether it’s a maintenance or an improvement goal. We can help setup alerts that are based off of this dashboard’s queries so they can catch SAD regressions quickly.



Additionally, PH-team will post weekly SAD updates analyzing the progress/regress of each team and the overall SAD rate.

Inbox is not really usable IMO.  for usability, I put some thoughts down in a gdoc. Mostly using Email as an example of a product with great organizational tools.

Hey Sarah, on HM retention. That second query with 20% retention is more accurate than the 1st query. The volumes here were very low (20 activated businesses, and 4 retained).

 In the first query there seems to have been a bug -- instead of looking up any activity in Week 3, it looked up any activity on the first day of Week 3. since the volumes of HM were so low (20 activated businesses) looking up only 1 day of data yielded 0 retained businesses. 

However, when the query was fixed to look up any activity in a 7-day period, it returned 4 active businesses (out of 20; hence 20% retention rate).

yes Wei's understanding is accurate. Different denominator.  Way more people start the onboarding flow and are included in the reversion calc, but to make it into the denominator for retention its a much higher bar because you need to complete the onboarding flow and then send a message
Sarah
March 19

ok got it! and i assume we can’t really do the reversion math on the 20 businesses?
You sent

that's a good question. I'm assuming this data is all our of retention at this point. there may have been a way at the time
